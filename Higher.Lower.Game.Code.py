""""# ---Points for improvement---

# - Extend this program to ask the for the name in a safer way, perhaps with a while loop?

# - Write additional logic into the gameplay loop so that each guess is stored
#Â   in a list and then if the user makes a duplicate guess, they are warned?

# - Make the gameplay loop give a warning if a number is guessed that is outside
#   the range of what is allowed? (Say if the low, high is 1, 10 but the user guesses a 12 for example).

# - Write a function to read the existing score file to the user before gameplay commences.

# - Difficult.. Make this a 2 player game!"""
